						CS132, <em>Creating Modern Web Applications</em>, is a spring semester course within the
						Brown CS department. The course has two tracks, one intended for CS concentrators,
						and one intended for non-concentrators with previous design experience. It takes a
						holistic look at the process of developing web and mobile applications and aims to bring the
						students to a point of mastery of many of the most used web technologies, and
						development practices. The course includes a semester long group final project
						in which the students will be working with external companies, non-profits, and
						other organizations.
					</p>
					<p>The class will be held in MacMillan 117 10am to 10:50am on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.</p>

					<h2 class="title">Final Projects</h2>

					<p>
						The materials covered in CS132 culminates in a final project, where students work
						in groups to implement a web application for a client.
						Examples of previous projects include:
					</p><ul>
						<li>A front end to let spectators provide input regarding music volume and fire status for Waterfire.</li>
						<li> A web site for posting of free cultural events in NYC</li>
						<li>Mobile remote for Shelby.tv</li>
						<li>Food truck locator</li>
						<li>Music player for one or more business locations</li>
						<li>Textbook exchange web site</li>
						<li>Visualizer for Tracelytics</li>
						<li>Web shell for MongoDB</li>
						<li>Polling using text messaging via Twilio</li>
					</ul>
					See the <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs132/submissions.html">submissions page</a> for information on submitting a project.
					<p></p>

					<p>
						CS132 will allow a number of student projects.   A successful student project proposal is:
					</p><ul>
						<li>
							Well-defined: you should know not only the specifics of your project
							(who would use it? how would they use it?), but what technologies you
							might use. You should also have a clear way of evaluating the project.
							Define what a successful project would look like.
						</li>
						<li>
							Well-scoped: the TAs have to believe it can be successfully completed during the semester by
							an appropriate team of students.
						</li>
						<li>
							Well-paced: you should have concrete milestones and checkpoints with your
							mentor TA throughout the semester.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						If your proposal is accepted you will serve as a mentor for your project.
						This means you'll be responsible for your project and the rest of your team.
						Other students will be able to select your project like any other and we will assign you an
						appropriate project team.
					</p>

					<p>
						Student project proposals should be sent to cs1320headtas@lists.brown.edu as early as possible
						and no later than the second class.  Project proposals should include a paragraph
						pitching your project to students.

					<h2 class="title">Different Tracks</h2>
					<div class="column">

						<h3 class="title">Concentrator</h3>
						<p>
						</p><ul>
							<li>
								The concentrator track will teach students everything they need to know to program
								a practical and workable web or mobile application.  It starts with HTML, covers
								JavaScript in the front end, various back end technologies, databases, as well as
								security, scaling and testing issues.  Students in this track can expect to do
								significant programming (mostly in JavaScript) on their assignments and in their
								final project.
							</li>
							<li>
								If you have not taken CS32, it is <b>completely acceptable</b> to take the
								concentrator track. Students who have taken CS32 will have had experience
								in working on large-scale, open-ended projects. Such experience is not a
								prerequisite for the course. However, students should bear in mind that the
								concentrator track of CS132 may be an intense experience, especially for
								students without previous web background. Expect assignments to take upwards
								of 5-10 hours to complete.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p></p>
					</div><!--col-lg-6-->
					<div class="column">
						<h3 class="title">Designer</h3>
						<p>
						</p><ul>
							<li>
								The "Designers" track is for students with a design background that would like to
								apply that background to creating web and mobile applications.  Students in this track
								are expected to be familiar with various design tools and have some background in HTML
								or web design.  Designers will be expected to take the lead role in the user interface
								design for their final project.
							</li>
							<li>
								The "Designers" track does involve some programming, but to a much smaller
								degree than the concentrator track.  Assignments in this track will let students show
								off their design expertise rather than their programming skills.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3 class="title">Capstone</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Students taking CS132 for capstone credit must take the concentrator track. In addition, they are expected either to propose
								and guide a project or to act as the leader of their project team (or both).
							</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>Who should take CS132's Concentrator Track?</h2>
					<p>CS132's <b>concentrator track</b> is appropriate for any student who has completed an intro level CS course (CS15, CS17, CS19) or has equivalent programming experience. Students should be comfortable with basic programming concepts.</p>

					<p>Computer Science concentrators (or potential concentrators) are <b>highly encouraged</b>
						to take the concentrator track; a student who has taken CS15/17/19 has the required
						rigorous programming background to succeed in that track. First year students who have taken CS15/17/19 or equivalent are welcome to register for the course.</p>

					<p>CS33 (Introduction to Computer Systems) and CS32 (Introduction to Software Engineering) are listed on CAB as recommended courses. Having taken either of these courses certainly will make the material easier, but  they are by no means necessary for students to succeed in CS132's concentrator track.</p>

					<p> Students who wish to take CS132 as a capstone course must take CS132 through the concentrator track</p>

					<p> If you are still unsure about which track of the course is right for you contact the TAs: cs1320tas@lists.brown.edu</p>

					<h2>Who should take CS132's Design Track?</h2>

					<p>CS132's <b>design track</b> is appropriate for students with a <b> prior design background</b>. Students are expected to have an understanding of a design software of their choice. Students will learn how to apply their preexisting design knowledge to web design.</p>

					<p> The design track is most appropriate for non-concentrators with design experience, as well as most RISD students.</p>
