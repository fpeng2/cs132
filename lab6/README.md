# Redesign of Brown Dining

## First draft
### Design
My first impression of the homepage is the overflowed secondary
navigation bar, which left only one item on second line on my
computer. It is also misleading to have two horizontal navigation
bars on the homepage. So, I moved the navigation bar to the left,
making it more clear to be secondary. Also, it won't overflow. 
Users only need to scroll down. It should be a contemporary design
similar to 'scroll spy', where the content could still be on one page.
As users scrolling down, the vertical nav bar will automatically highlight
which part users are viewing.

### Critic
It sounds like a good redesign and many websites have taken the same
strategy. The problem is that the search bar sticks at top, and 
contents are actually search results. Maybe better to indicate this.

## Second draft
### Design
As the critic goes, search bar actually takes an important role in 
this web. Thus, we make a single-functioning homepage for search.
Search result will be shown as previously designed. Home page is left
with search bar only, at middle of the page.


### Critic
Better make it in the middle.

## Contents
The folder ``contents`` contains a image of two drafts and a mock-up
pdf with designed homepage and search result page.
